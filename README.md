# About

This project is part of the Salesforce session: Building reusable UIs with LWC: Build once, use everywhere

The project consist of 2 reusable components: boatReviews (parent) and boatReview (child).
The project also includes a Lightning Message Channel, where the review Id is sent whenever a button is selected in a boatReview.
Included in the repo is also a component that listens to messages and interacts with flow to send the selected review Id and navigate to the next page (reviewMessageToFlow).
